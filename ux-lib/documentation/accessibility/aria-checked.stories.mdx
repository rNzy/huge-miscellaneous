# aria-checked

## Intro

Indicates the current "checked" state of checkboxes, radio buttons, and other widgets. See related aria-pressed and aria-selected.

The aria-checked attribute indicates whether the element is checked (true), unchecked (false), or represents a group of other elements that have a mixture of checked and unchecked values (mixed). Most inputs only support values of true and false, but the mixed value is supported by certain tri-state inputs such as a checkbox or menuitemcheckbox.

The mixed value is not supported on radio or menuitemradio or any element that inherits from these in the taxonomy, and user agents MUST treat a mixed value as equivalent to false for those roles.
