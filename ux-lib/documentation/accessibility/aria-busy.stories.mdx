# aria-busy

## Intro

Indicates whether an element, and its subtree, are currently being updated.

The default is that aria-busy is false. If authors know that multiple parts of the same element need to be loaded or modified, they can set aria-busy to true when the first part is loaded, and then set aria-busy to false when the last part is loaded. When a widget is missing required owned elements due to script execution or loading, authors MUST mark a containing element with aria-busy equal to true. For example, until a page is fully initialized and complete, an author could mark the document element as busy. If there is an error updating the element, author MAY set the aria-invalid attribute to true.
