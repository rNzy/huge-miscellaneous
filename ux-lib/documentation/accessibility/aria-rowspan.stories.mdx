# aria-rowspan

## Intro

Defines the number of rows spanned by a cell or gridcell within a table, grid, or treegrid. See related aria-rowindex and aria-colspan.

This attribute is intended for cells and gridcells which are not contained in a native table. When defining the row span of cells or gridcells in a native table, authors SHOULD use the host language's attribute instead of aria-rowspan. If aria-rowspan is used on an element for which the host language provides an equivalent attribute, user agents MUST ignore the value of aria-rowspan and instead expose the value of the host language's attribute to assistive technologies.

Authors MUST set the value of aria-rowspan to an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than the value which would cause the cell or gridcell to overlap the next cell or gridcell in the same column. Setting the value to 0 indicates that the cell or gridcell is to span all the remaining rows in the row group.
