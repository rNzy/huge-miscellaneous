# aria-valuemax

## Intro

Defines the maximum allowed value for a range widget.

Authors MUST ensure the value of aria-valuemax is greater than or equal to the value of aria-valuemin. If the aria-valuenow has a known maximum and minimum, the author SHOULD provide properties for aria-valuemax and aria-valuemin.

> **NOTE**

> A range widget starts with a given value, which can be increased until reaching the maximum value, defined by this property. Declaring the minimum and maximum values allows assistive technology to convey the size of the range to users.
