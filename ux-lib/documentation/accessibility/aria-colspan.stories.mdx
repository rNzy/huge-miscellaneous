# aria-colspan

## Intro

Defines the number of columns spanned by a cell or gridcell within a table, grid, or treegrid. See related aria-colindex and aria-rowspan.

This attribute is intended for cells and gridcells which are not contained in a native table. When defining the column span of cells or gridcells in a native table, authors SHOULD use the host language's attribute instead of aria-colspan. If aria-colspan is used on an element for which the host language provides an equivalent attribute, user agents MUST ignore the value of aria-colspan and instead expose the value of the host language's attribute to assistive technologies.

Authors MUST set the value of aria-colspan to an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than the value which would cause the cell or gridcell to overlap the next cell or gridcell in the same row.
