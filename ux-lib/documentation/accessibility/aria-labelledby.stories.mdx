# aria-labelledby

## Intro

Identifies the element (or elements) that labels the current element. See related aria-describedby.

The purpose of aria-labelledby is the same as that of aria-label. It provides the user with a recognizable name of the object. The most common accessibility API mapping for a label is the accessible name property.

If the interface is such that it is not possible to have a visible label on the screen, authors SHOULD use aria-label and SHOULD NOT use aria-labelledby. As required by the text alternative computation, user agents give precedence to aria-labelledby over aria-label when computing the accessible name property.

The aria-labelledby attribute is similar to aria-describedby in that both reference other elements to calculate a text alternative, but a label should be concise, where a description is intended to provide more verbose information.
