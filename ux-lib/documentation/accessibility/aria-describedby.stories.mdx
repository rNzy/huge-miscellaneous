# aria-describedby

## Intro

Identifies the element (or elements) that describes the object. See related aria-labelledby.

The aria-labelledby attribute is similar to the aria-describedby in that both reference other elements to calculate a text alternative, but a label should be concise, where a description is intended to provide more verbose information.

The element or elements referenced by the aria-describedby comprise the entire description. Include ID references to multiple elements if necessary, or enclose a set of elements (e.g., paragraphs) with the element referenced by the ID.

- @SPEC
  - @MUST
  - @HOWTO / REFERENCES
